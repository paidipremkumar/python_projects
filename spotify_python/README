1. In order to create a playlist in Spotify you must have an account with Spotify. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for a free one here: http://spotify.com/signup/

2. Once you've signed up/ signed in, go to the developer dashboard and create a new Spotify App:

https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/


3. Once you've created a Spotify app, copy the Client ID and Client Secret into your Python project.


Spotify uses OAuth to allow third-party applications (e.g. our Python code) to access a Spotify user's account without giving them the username or password. We'll explore OAuth more in later modules on web development, but if you want you can read more about it here: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth

Authenticating with Spotify is quite complicated, especially when you want to access a user's account. So instead, we're going to use one of the most popular Python Spotify modules - Spotipy to make things easier.

Now that you've come so far and completed 45 days of Python, you're going to approach this challenge like a real developer, figuring things out from the documentation.



4. Using the Spotipy documentation, figure out how to authenticate your Python project with Spotify using your unique Client ID/ Client Secret.



5. Use http://example.com as your Redirect URI. You're looking to get the currentuser id (your Spotify username). As per the documentation, make sure you set the redirect URI in the Spotify Dashboard as well.

Then it will take you to the page below, example.com and you need to copy the entire URL in the address bar:


Finally, you need to paste the URL into the prompt in PyCharm:


Now if you close PyCharm and restart, you should see a new file in this project called token.txt


5. Get the user id of the authenticated user (your Spotify username).
